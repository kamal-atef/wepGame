              A deadly symbiote invasion brings devastation to New York City. In
              Spider-Man: Web of Shadows, the game is set in an apocalyptic
              vision of the city. You'll have complete control over New York
              City's salvation and the fate of Spider-man. It also features an
              all-new combat system that allows for three-dimensional battles
              that can start on the street and end up on rooftops. You can also
              switch between the red and black Spider-Man suits, choose to ally
              with Marvel's heroes or villains and decide what missions to
              undertake to save Manhattan from destruction. Not-So-Friendly
              Neighborhood Spider-Man - A fusion of web-slinging and powerful
              combat moves combine to create an unbeatable, all-new fighting
              system that intuitively blends Spider-Man's speed and strength
              with the environment for deadly new attacks and combos Anything
              Goes - At a moment's notice, you can harness the grace, agility
              and acrobatics of Spider-Man Red Suit, or leverage the brute,
              savage power of the Black Suit. Switch suits at any time to create
              devastating never-before-seen combos and finishing moves The City
              That Never Sleeps - Teeming with life, the Big Apple is more alive
              than ever before in the Spider-Man series. Citizens will either
              cheer Spider-Man on or run away in fear, depending on your actions
              and decisions Increased city interactivity and destructibility
              allow you to pick up and use anything in your way as a weapon,
              destroy store fronts, demolish vehicles, and virtually obliterate
              city streets with powerful attacks With some of the greatest
              heroes and most notorious villains in the Marvel Universe,
              including staples such as Luke Cage and Vulture, your choices
              control who will ultimately aid you in the fight to rid New York
              of the alien symbiote
